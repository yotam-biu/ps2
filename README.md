PS2: Simple Statistics
This assignment introduces basic statistics through Python functions. You will create and test three functions for finding the maximum number, calculating the mean, and calculating the standard deviation of three given numbers.

Files
simple_statistic.ipynb: The main notebook for the assignment. It contains instructions, code cells to fill in, and tests for each function.
math_utils.py: A module to store your completed functions after testing in the notebook. You will copy each function from the notebook into this file once they work correctly.
Instructions
Open simple_statistic.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Follow the instructions for each part of the assignment:

Part 1: Find the Maximum Number
Create a function find_max_number that takes three numbers as input and returns the maximum value.
Part 2: Mean Calculation
Create a function find_mean that takes three numbers as input and returns the mean. Remember to use 
�
=
3
n=3 in the formula.
Part 3: Standard Deviation Calculation
Create a function find_mean_std that calculates both the mean and standard deviation of three numbers. Use find_mean from Part 2 to calculate the mean.
Testing Functions:
For each function, test it using the provided example values to ensure accuracy.

Copy Functions to math_utils.py:
Once each function works as expected, copy it into math_utils.py in the same format.

GitHub Submission:

Make sure all code is working.
Push your changes to GitHub. Verify that math_utils.py contains your functions and that all code passes the provided tests.
